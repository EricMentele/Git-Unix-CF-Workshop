Git is a database of what you are creating. It saves each state you commit as a static place in time for that project. Git init makes a git repository, or staging area, in the directory you are in. Git add chooses which files to add to that repository, this will focus on modifications made in successive adds. git commit creates a snapshot in time of your work. Git branch will create a branch or display what branches you have selected. git checkout will change branches. -D will delete a branch. ex git branch -D mybranch. Only final state code should be on the master line. Work should be on branches.
